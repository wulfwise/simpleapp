# Simple Demo

This is a simple Flask app with some forms and a MySQL backend. It's useful as a basis for demos of things I use for work.

This app expects a valid `newrelic.ini` file to be present. You can find out more about that here: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/advanced-install-new-relic-python-agent
